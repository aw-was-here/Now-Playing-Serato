Settings

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - Port
     - The HTTP server's TCP port.  For security reasons, a firewall should protect this port to limit which hosts
       will be permitted to connect.
   * - HTML Template
     - The `Jinja2 template <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/>`_ file that will be used when the song
       updates when fetching index.html. See `Templates <templatevariables.html>`_ for more information.
   * - Once
     - Only give index.html once per title, then giving a page that does nothing but refresh until the next song change.
       This setting is very useful to provide a simple way to do fade-in, fade-out using very simple HTML.


Supported URLs
--------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - URL
     - Description
   * - /index.html (or /index.htm or just /)
     - This URL generates either a title card based upon the preconfigured template or
       a refresh document.  The title card will be given exactly once upon connection with
       the refresh document being returned in subsequent connections until a new track has
       been detected.  This process allows for using fades and other HTML tricks.
   * - /index.txt
     - Same output as the text output in the General settings.
   * - /cover.png
     - This URL will return the cover image, if available.

REST API
--------

Currently, only a very rudimentary REST API is implememnted.  `/v1/last` will return a JSON-formatted string of the currently
playing track.


WebSockets
----------

New with version 3.0.0 is a continual feed via WebSockets. The feed is a JSON-formatted stream that will get an update
on every title change.  To connect, use the URL `ws://hostname:port/wsstream`
